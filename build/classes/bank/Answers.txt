1. a) Yes data race is present in the Account class.The shared 
      resource, "balance" can be updated by several threads 
      simaltenously prompting to undefinete states.

   b) In deposit method "balance" will be updated.Few threads can 
      access balance of the same object simaltenously. So those updates
      can lead to undetermined states.For an example,An update done
      by a one thread can be lost to another thread.


   c) Id number should be identical.If 2 objects of Accounts class
      created at same time by 2 different threads,the id numbers of
      these accounts can be in faulty.

   d) deposit()
      transfer()



2. b) No starvation.


   c) Yes.Deadlock is present.Lets say we have 2 object A and B
      A dedadlock can occur if A tries to give money to B at the 
      same time B tries to give money to A. This is due to the 
      locks we impose on both objects. 


      We can avoid the deadlock by putting both deposit method
      call into same syrnchronized lock.But this may make the process
      sequential.
