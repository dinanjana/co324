No it's not.If it is not handled corectly it wil lead to 
server offline because it will cause to skip 'for' loop.


Exercise 5

If an error occured program will stop without
closing the socket.If it kept open other programs 
won't be able to connect to that socket.Finally 
block executes always.So if the action
required to close a socket placed on that block,
socket will close after the end of a session always.
