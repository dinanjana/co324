1) If we stop using a delimiter, server 
   will not read untill it reaches the 
   end of an incoming message.In this case
   the message will only be displayed in
   server after stopping the execution of
   the client programme.

   If the user accidently put "-" client 
   will consider that character as the 
   delimiter and will break the packet
   from that point

2) i) "\n",space characters will be taken as
      a delimiter.
